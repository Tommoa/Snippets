Proving Jonathan Blow wrong about C++ ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo6_tJFeNMM][Demo: Quick Lambdas, Looping Polymorph Solver]]).

About 28 min in, Jonathan Blow talks about passing templated functions as function pointers and claims that its impossible with C++. I counter with this.
I prefer the way he does it in Jai, but still, it can be done, and its not too ugly.
Also, I should be able to get the size of the array using sizeof().

Tested with clang++ v4.0.0 and g++ v7.1.1 on Arch Linux
