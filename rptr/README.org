* rptr

** Usage

*** Templating
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
template <typename T, typename S = int, typename A = unsigned long>
#+END_SRC
 - T
Refers to the type that the rptr will be pointing to.
 - S
The maximum distance of the rptr.
 - A
How the memory is addressed (for x64 its unsigned long).

*** Constructors
 1. #+BEGIN_SRC rptr() #+END_SRC - Makes rptr refer to itself. Dereferencing a pointer called like this will throw an error.
 2. #+BEGIN_SRC rptr(T* to) #+END_SRC - Makes a pointer to object #+BEGIN_SRC to #+END_SRC
 3. #+BEGIN_SRC rptr(T* to, void* base) #+END_SRC - Makes a pointer to object #+BEGIN_SRC to #+END_SRC relative to base pointer #+BEGIN_SRC base #+END_SRC
 4. #+BEGIN_SRC rptr(T* to, A base) #+END_SRC - Makes a pointer to object #+BEGIN_SRC to #+END_SRC relative to base address #+BEGIN_SRC base #+END_SRC

*** Methods
 1. #+BEGIN_SRC void change(T* to) #+END_SRC - Changes the rptr to refer to object #+BEGIN_SRC to #+END_SRC
 2.
