* rptr

** Usage

*** Templating
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
template <typename T, typename S = int, typename A = unsigned long>
#+END_SRC
 - ~T~
Refers to the type that the rptr will be pointing to.
 - ~S~
The maximum distance of the rptr.
 - ~A~
How the memory is addressed (for x64 its unsigned long).

*** Constructors
 1. ~rptr()~ - Makes rptr refer to itself. Dereferencing a pointer called like this will throw an error.
 2. ~rptr(T* to)~ - Makes a pointer to object ~to~
 3. ~rptr(T* to, void* base)~ - Makes a pointer to object ~to~ relative to base pointer ~base~
 4. ~rptr(T* to, A base)~ - Makes a pointer to object ~to~ relative to base address ~base~

*** Methods
 1. ~BEGIN_SRC void change(T* to)~ - Changes the rptr to refer to object ~to~
 2.
